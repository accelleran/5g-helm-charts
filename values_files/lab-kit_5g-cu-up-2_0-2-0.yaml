  # dRAX Specific Node Selector
  #   Description: This is a special nodeSelector field implemented for the
  #                Accelleran 5G Helm charts. You need to first label your
  #                node in Kubernetes with a label "draxName" and give it a
  #                <value>. For example for node <node_name>, you can use the
  #                following command to label it:
  #                kubectl label node <node_name> draxName=<value>.
  #                You can then enabled this feature by setting
  #                "draxNodeSelectorEnabled" to "true" (as a string with quotes!).
  #                The in "draxName" set the value of the label you chose for
  #                the node. This will in effect install all the 5G Application
  #                on that node, without the need to edit all individual helm
  #                charts. In case you want to add other nodeSelector options,
  #                you have to add them to the helm chart specific values files.
  #   Value type: string
  #   Example:
  #
  draxNodeSelectorEnabled: "false"
  draxName: "edge"
